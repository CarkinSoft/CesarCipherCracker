Hello, Welcome to CesarCracker!

This is a program that can read any text document encoded
using the Cesar cipher and output the translated text
line by line!

To use my program simply have your input text
located in the same directory as the CesarCracker.py
program file as well as the dictionary.
I will be sending these all together so it should be there.
Simply run the program and it will prompt you for
the title of your input file.
Once you give it the title it will run and output the
location it saved the decoded message to.

Thank you for using my program :)
