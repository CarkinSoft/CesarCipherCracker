Hello, Welcome to CesarCracker!

This is a program that can read any text document encoded
using the Cesar cipher and output the translated text
line by line!

To use my program simply have your encrypted text
located in the same directory as the CesarCracker.py
program file.

Run the program in commandline and it will prompt you for
the title of your input file.
Once you give it the title it will run and output the
location it saved the decoded message to.

Thank you for using my program :)
